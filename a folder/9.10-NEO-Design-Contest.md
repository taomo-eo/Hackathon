## Background

NEO, a world renowned blockchain project, has made substantial progress in recent years in the areas of technical development and the growth of its global community. 

The community has always been a driving force in the advancement of the NEO ecosystem, with developers all over the world contributing through the development of dApps, tools, and contributions to the NEO codebase. 

NEO Global Development recognizes the importance of community contributions and would like to encourage more talented individuals to join the effort in helping realize the vision of a NEO Smart Economy. 

For this purpose, NEO Global Development is hosting the NEO Creative Design Competition. The competition calls on creative individuals to help NEO improve its branding and visual communications. Participants are tasked with creating a new design for neo.org as well as icons for key NEO ecosystem concepts. 

Over 200,000 RMB in prizes is up for grabs in GAS equivalent, with the potential of further collaboration between the winners and NEO Global Development.

All designers, illustrators, and creative professionals are welcome to enter.


**About NEO:**

As a non-profit community-driven blockchain project, NEO uses blockchain technology and digital identity to create digital assets that can be managed by smart contracts. NEO believes that by combining digital identity, digital assets and smart contracts with a distributed network, a new “Smart Economy” can be realized.

NEO was founded in 2014 and was open sourced on GitHub in June 2015. NEO places a large emphasis on community development, which has led to the growth of a huge global developer community that continuously contributes to NEO ecosystem. Thousands of community members are active on Reddit, Discord, Github and Twitter. (More details can be found at http://neo.org)


## Theme

The NEO Creative Design Competition will include two competition categories: 

1.	NEO website design, &;
  2.NEO icon design. 

Participants are encouraged to keep NEO’s theme of a “Smart Economy” at the heart of their designs.


#### NEO Website design

The NEO website plays an essential role in NEO’s brand. It is a primary source of information for many developers, community members and businesses who are seeking resources or wanting to learn more about the platform. The aesthetics and ease of navigation can leave a lasting impression on visitors. Ensuring users can find the information they require is a critical function of the NEO website.

Participants who choose to tackle the website design category should consider the different user groups and their purpose for visiting the website. Design elements should communicate both the technological concepts of NEO and its community-driven nature, whilst keeping the Smart Economy vision in focus.


#### NEO Icon Design

NEO is an original public blockchain project with many self-defined concepts representing essential parts of the ecosystem. Elements such as NeoGas, NeoContract and NeoVM are already integral features of the platform, whilst others such as NeoFS, NeoX and NeoQS are in development and will play an important role in NEO’s future. To explain and promote understanding of these concepts, participants are invited to design icons that represent their functionality and utility.

The icon designs should contain unique elements that reference the features and roles of each concept, whilst harmonizing with NEO’s visual identity. Participants are required to choose at least 5 out of the 10 concepts given below. At least 5 icons (one for each concept) shall be submitted.

•	NeoGas 
•	NeoAsset
